<p>I've must have been blind<br>
Not to see you look away from me<br>
Whenever you say &quot;You love me still&quot;</p>
<p>I must have been crazy<br>
Not to feel you slip away from me<br>
Day after day there's a space to fill</p>
<p>And I can't find the words, to make you fall in love with me agian<br>
And I can't find the strength to let you go oh oh</p>
<p>And when it's all said and done, you'll be the only one<br>
Even when there's nothing left for us to say</p>
<p>As sure as the sun will rise I can never say goodbye<br>
Even when we go our separate ways<br>
In my heart you'll always stay</p>
<p>Ooh ooh</p>
<p>Been spending my time<br>
Trying to remind you of our love<br>
But you're pulling away with every touch</p>
<p>With all we've been through<br>
I'd never thought I'd be losing you<br>
And I would give everything to keep you here</p>
<p>But I can't (but I can't) find the words (find the words)<br>
to make you fall in love with me again<br>
And I can't (and I can't) find the strength (find the strength)<br>
to let you go oh oh</p>
<p>And when it's all said and done, you'll be the only one<br>
Even when there's nothing left for us to say (nothing left to say)<br>
As sure as the sun will rise I can never say goodbye<br>
Even when we go our separate ways (ooh)<br>
In my heart you'll always stay</p>
<p>I, I, I still believe our love its meant to be oh<br>
And it will be here forever come one day (come one day) ooh ohoh<br>
Can you see? I love you faithfully oh yeh<br>
And one day I'm telling you I find a way to get back to me ooh</p>
<p>And when it's all said and done,you'll be the only one (said and done)<br>
Oooh, ooh (nothing left to say)<br>
As sure as the sun will rise I can never say goodbye<br>
Even if we go our separate ways<br>
In my heart you'll always stay</p>
<p>Oohh umm<br>
Ooohh</p>

<p>Nobody knows who I really am<br>
I never felt this empty before<br>
And if I ever need someone to come along<br>
Who's gonna comfort me, and keep me strong</p>
<p>We are all rowing the boat of fate<br>
The waves keep on coming and we can't escape<br>
But if we ever get lost on our way<br>
The waves would guide you through another day</p>
<p>远くで息をしてる　透明になったみたい<br>
暗闇に思えたけど　目隠しされてただけ<br>
祈りをささげて　新しい日を待つ<br>
鲜やかに　光る海　その果てまで</p>
<p>Nobody knows who I really am<br>
Maybe they just don't give a damn<br>
But if I ever need someone to come along<br>
I know you would follow me, and keep me strong</p>
<p>人の心はうつりゆく　抜け出したくなる<br>
つきはまた新しい周期で　舟を连れてく</p>
<p>And every time I see your face,<br>
the oceans heave up to my heart<br>
You make me wanna strain at the oars,<br>
and soon I can see the shore</p>
<p>Ah，I can't see the shore<br>
When will l see the shore</p>
<p>I want you to know who I really am<br>
I never thought I'd feel this way towards you<br>
And if you ever need someone to come along<br>
I will follow you, and keep you strong</p>
<p>旅はまだ続いてく　穏やかな日も<br>
つきはまた新しい周期で　舟を照らし出す<br>
祈りをささげて　新しい日を待つ<br>
鲜やかに　光る海　その果てまで</p>
<p>And every time I see your face,<br>
the oceans heave up to my heart<br>
You make me wanna strain at the oars,<br>
and soon I can see the shore</p>
<p>运命の船を漕ぎ<br>
波は次から次へと私たちを袭うけど<br>
それも素敌な旅ね　どれも素敌な旅ね</p>
